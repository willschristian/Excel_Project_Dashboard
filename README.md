# Coffee Retail Analysis(Interactive Dashboard on Excel)
## Project Background 
This project explores a coffee retail dataset. The aim is to understand how product type, roast, size, country, and loyalty influence total revenue, customer value, and product performance.
The dataset captures customer location, loyalty, products ordered, and sales, enabling analysis of sales patterns, key customers, and regional demand. The end result is a fully interactive Excel dashboard and reporting analysis to support product mix, pricing, and loyalty retention strategy decisions.
